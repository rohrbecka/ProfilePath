///
/// The line description may consist of several boudary conditions. A line is uniquely described by a start and an
/// end point. In some cases it may also enough to give less information, e.g. only the end point,
/// where the line is appended directly to a precedent element with a defined end point.
/// ``Line`` is therefore relying on ``PathBuilder`` tp generate a path out of it.
/// Therefore, a ``Line`` description can't be 'incomplete' only within the context given by the other Path elements
/// it may be insufficient to be uniquely defined, which may prevent rendering.
